Normalization:
Most tables have been normalized to 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
Redundant data has been eliminated by creating relationships using foreign keys. 
For example, the Trips table references Buses and Routes instead of duplicating their data. 
Fields like Stops in the Routes table remain denormalized (stored as text) 
to simplify queries involving route descriptions.

Denormalization:
I storedd the Stops attribute in the Routes table as a single field instead 
of a separate table to reduce query complexity and improve performance for route-based queries. 

I added constraints like CHECK, NOT NULL, and UNIQUE ensure data integrity and validity 
at the database level.
