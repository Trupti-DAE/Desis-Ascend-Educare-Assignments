Normalization Process:
The database is normalized to 3NF to eliminate redundancy. 
Each table represents a single entity or relationship, 
and data is stored with minimal duplication. 
For example: The Dish table contains only information about dishes, not tied to specific orders.
The Order table references User, Restaurant through foreign keys.

Denormalization Justification:
The Order table contains a Delivery_Address field instead of linking 
it to a separate address table. This is for simplicity and to improve query performance 
since most orders will have unique addresses.

Phone Numbers as Strings:
Storing phone numbers as VARCHAR prevents loss of leading zeroes and supports country codes. 
However, it makes numeric operations (e.g., finding ranges) harder. 

Constraints:
Unique constraints ensure no duplicate users, dishes, or orders. 
Foreign keys maintain relationships and data integrity. Constraints like NOT NULL enforce required fields.

Data types like DECIMAL for prices and ratings ensure precise values. 

Indexes for Performance:
Primary keys and foreign keys are indexed automatically, 
ensuring efficient querying for relationships like User and Order or Order and Payment.
